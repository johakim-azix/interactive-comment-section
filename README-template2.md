### Continued development
Starting from the current implementation i currently made, i want dive a bit deeper by adding some additional concepts i'm actually learning like :
- Building more responsive user interfaces.

- Better structure my code.

- Building more robust and Asynchronous javascript with the available methods (assync / await). i should get used to them and also use try catch to avoid poor user experience and with bugs...

- Using web storage; that will get it a bit more realistic with data persisted data. this is meant to get me knowing a more about web storage and it's behavior, then i could use it to increase user experience quality on my apps.

- Move to backend with js !!!!!!
