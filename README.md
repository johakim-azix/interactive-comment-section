## My process
Default displayed comments are actually taken from local file data.json witch contain a bunch of comment and the current user.
Comments aren't actually persited anywhere, instead the are store in an array, so you'll get back to default comments set once you refresh or close the window.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla js

### Continued development
Starting from the current implementation i currently made, i want dive a bit deeper by adding some additional concepts i'm actually learning like :
- Building more responsive user interfaces.

- Better structure my code.

- Building more robust and Asynchronous javascript with the available methods (assync / await). i should get used to them and also use try catch to avoid poor user experience and with bugs...

- Using web storage; that will get it a bit more realistic with data persisted data. this is meant to get me knowing a more about web storage and it's behavior, then i could use it to increase user experience quality on my apps.

- Move to backend with js !!!!!!
